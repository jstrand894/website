::: {.callout-note title="Weather"}
â›… Low 50s, partly sunny. Cool and pleasant with occasional sunbreaks.

Eric, Aden, and I drove back out to Elk Park to finish up building the exclosure fence. We then drove over to Badger Gulch for our first visit of 2025 to retrieve weather data and install the trail cameras.

We had leftover fencing from our South Dakota trip (exactly the right amount!) so we used that to wrap around the entire Elk Park exclosure. I also retreived images from the trail cameras I set up during our last visit on May 8, 2025. 

Site activities 

- Finish building exclosure
- Add stakes to control grid where slash piles make road hares unusable
- Retrieve preliminary images from trail cameras
