As agricultural expansion and invasive species reshape the Northern Great Plains, the ecological relationships between plants, pests, and their natural enemies are undergoing profound shifts. My research investigates how biological control agents interact with host plants and their environments to suppress pest populations and restore ecological balance. From wheat-dominated agroecosystems to rangeland invasions, I explore how chemical signaling, habitat structure, and multi-species interactions can be leveraged to enhance biocontrol efficacy and support resilient landscapes.

  <div class="mr-title"><strong>PhD Research:</strong> <em>Biological Control of Yellow and Dalmatian Toadflax in Montana and South Dakota</em></div>
  <img src="images/phd/rhinusa.jpg" alt="Rhinusa pilosa" loading="lazy">
  <p>
    Funded primarily by the US Forest Service, my PhD research investigates the establishment of the biological control agent <em>Rhinusa pilosa</em> and its ability to suppress populations of yellow toadflax (<em>Linaria vulgaris</em>) and Dalmatian toadflax (<em>Linaria dalmatica</em>) in Montana and South Dakota. I study how these insects respond to chemical cues from their host plants and how these interactions affect herbivore survival, parasitism, and plant suppression.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently pursuing several interconnected projects:
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Establishment of <em>Rhinusa pilosa</em> in controlling yellow toadflax populations:</strong> assessing survival, dispersal, and impact on plant density at release sites.</li>
      <li><strong>Impacts of large herbivores on toadflax and <em>Rhinusa</em> establishment:</strong> constructing herbivore exclusion fences around release sites and monitoring herbivore activity in adjacent control areas.</li>
      <li><strong>Comparative stress assessment on yellow toadflax caused by <em>Rhinusa pilosa</em> and <em>Mecinus janthinis</em>:</strong> measuring plant health and chemical emissions to determine how each insect affects the plant individually and simultaneously.</li>
      <li><strong>Multiple Decrement Life table analyses of <em>Mecinus janthinis</em> and <em>Mecinus janthiniformis</em>:</strong> quantifying mortality and performance under field conditions, including the effects of parasitoids, temperature extremes, and other environmental factors, on both yellow and Dalmatian toadflax populations.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Why this work matters:</strong><br>
    Invasive toadflax species can severely impact rangeland and cropland ecosystems. Biological control offers a sustainable alternative to chemical herbicides, reducing non-target impacts and supporting ecological balance. By elucidating host-specific behaviors, chemical cues, and multi-agent interactions, this research informs strategic releases and conservation of biocontrol agents to maximize suppression of toadflax populations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, this project contributes to understanding how plant-insect interactions, chemical signaling, and agent diversity can be harnessed to manage invasive plants and promote resilient agroecosystems across the Northern Great Plains.

  <div class="mr-title"><strong>Masters Research:</strong> <em>Chemical Ecology and Agroecological Importance of Smooth Brome in Biological Control of Wheat Stem Sawfly</em></div>
  <img src="images/masters/DJI_0096.JPG" alt="Smooth brome field — Masters Research photograph" loading="lazy">
<p>
    Funded by the Montana Wheat and Barley Committee, my thesis combined chemical ecology, behavioral assays, and field surveys to investigate how volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by WSS-infested smooth brome influence parasitoid attraction and efficacy. Using electroantennography and gas chromatography, we found that smooth brome under sawfly attack emitted elevated levels of key volatiles — (<em>Z</em>)-3-hexenyl acetate, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and (<em>E</em>)-2-hexenal — that elicited strong antennal and behavioral responses from both <em>Bracon</em> parasitoid species.
</p>
<p> 
    In controlled olfactometer and wind tunnel trials, parasitoids consistently preferred volatile blends from infested smooth brome over those from infested wheat. Field surveys across central and northern Montana revealed that smooth brome adjacent to wheat fields had comparable sawfly infestation rates but significantly lower larval survival — up to 43.6% greater mortality than in wheat. Moreover, parasitism rates in smooth brome were consistently higher, especially in fall-collected stems, suggesting that this grass provides a valuable seasonal refuge for parasitoids. 
</p>

<p><strong>Why this work matters:</strong><br>
    In an era of declining pesticide efficacy and increasing resistance, biological control remains one of the most sustainable tools in integrated pest management. By demonstrating that smooth brome can enhance parasitoid populations and reduce pest survival, this research reframes the role of a commonly maligned grass species. Rather than viewing smooth brome solely as an invasive threat, we propose its strategic conservation and placement as a functional component of agroecosystems — especially in landscapes where wheat and native parasitoids co-occur.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, this work contributes to a broader understanding of how plant-insect interactions, chemical signaling, and landscape structure can be harnessed to support ecological resilience and sustainable agriculture in the Northern Great Plains' dry-land cropping systems.</p>
