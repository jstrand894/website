    "text": "Research Interests\nI am interested in understanding the ecological roles of insects and their potential to address pressing global challenges, including improving agricultural productivity, combating climate change, and advancing waste management strategies. Through my research, I seek to develop innovative, nature-based solutions to these complex problems, focusing on the intersection of entomology, ecology, and sustainability.\nMy master’s thesis with Dr. David Weaver at Montana State University focused on the agroecological role of smooth brome grass in managing wheat stem sawfly (WSS) populations. Specifically, I investigated how smooth brome found along roadways and in coulees could reduce WSS larvae and provide a refuge for parasitoids like Bracon cephi and B. lissogaster. Using a combination of volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis and field observations, I demonstrated that smooth brome, when found growing adjacent to wheat fields, could reduce WSS survival and support second-generation parasitoids. Please see my thesis or my thesis defense recording for more information.\nMy current PhD project with Dr. Robert Peterson at Montana State University is investigating the efficacy of the weevil Rhinusa pilosa for the biological control of invasive yellow toadflax (Linaria vulgaris) in Montana and South Dakota. Specifically, I am interested in the ecological impacts of megaherbivores, parastioids, and climatic shifts on the establishment of beneficial R. pilosa populations."
