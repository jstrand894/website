title: "Basketball Roster Analysis Tool"
date: 2019-5-20
description: "A fun side project: From 2017 to 2019, I built my own NBA roster analysis tool to explore roster construction, free agency, and per-game metrics. While the data is now out of date, the toolâ€™s functionality still works as intended."
