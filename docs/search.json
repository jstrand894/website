Through my research, I seek to develop innovative, nature-based solutions to these complex problems, focusing on the intersection of entomology, ecology, and sustainability.\nMy master’s thesis with Dr. David Weaver focused on the agroecological role of smooth brome grass in managing wheat stem sawfly (WSS) populations. Specifically, I investigated how smooth brome could serve as a trap crop to reduce WSS larvae and provide a refuge for parasitoids like Bracon cephi and B. lissogaster. Using a combination of volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis and field observations, I demonstrated that smooth brome, when grown adjacent to wheat fields, could reduce WSS survival and support second-generation parasitoids. Please see my thesis defense for more detailed findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Image Gallery\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  You can view my CV contents below, or download my CV here:\n  \n    View my CV"

    "text": "Research Interests zzzzz\nI am broadly interested in understanding the ecological roles of insects and their potential to address pressing global challenges, including improving agricultural productivity, combating climate change, and advancing waste management strategies. Through my research, I seek to develop innovative, nature-based solutions to these complex problems, focusing on the intersection of entomology, ecology, and sustainability.\nMy master’s thesis with Dr. David Weaver focused on the agroecological role of smooth brome grass in managing wheat stem sawfly (WSS) populations. Specifically, I investigated how smooth brome could serve as a trap crop to reduce WSS larvae and provide a refuge for parasitoids like Bracon cephi and B. lissogaster. Using a combination of volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis and field observations, I demonstrated that smooth brome, when grown adjacent to wheat fields, could reduce WSS survival and support second-generation parasitoids. Please see my thesis defense for more detailed findings.\n\n\n  You can view my CV contents below, or download my CV here:\n  \n    View my CV\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Image Gallery"
