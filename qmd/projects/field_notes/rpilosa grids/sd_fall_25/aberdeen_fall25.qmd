# Schaunaman Ranch  
::: {.callout-note title="Weather"}
üå¶Ô∏è High 70s, cloudy, some drizzle in the morning. Sooooo many mosquitos ü¶ü.
:::
 
Eric and I left Bozeman at 6:30 AM on Sunday, August 31, arriving in Aberdeen at 5:00 PM. On Monday, September 1, we visited the Schaunaman Ranch to get data from our *Rhinusa pilosa* grids and *M. janthinus* transects.

## Rhinusa Grids
- No galls in the exclosure or control
- Exclosure toadflax was sparse and thin in structure
- Both cameras had the metal covers torn off (possibly from wind)
- Observed more red stems, unclear cause
- Grass was dense, making roadhairs hard to find
- Mosquitos were very bad in the morning, improved later
- Foggy in the morning
- Replaced open control camera due to water ingress
- No issues with data loggers; no battery replacements
- Plant density higher in control than exclosure
- Released 600 insects in both control and exclosure

## Transects
- Some signs of external feeding
- No live insects; Eric noted potential internal feeding by splitting a few stems
- Added orange stakes on the corn-side transects within bushes
- Non-corn-side transects hard to locate; placed metal posts at start of each line
- Chris Hemen released 600 insects on non-corn side

# Sand Lake and Bergdorf WPAs
::: {.callout-note title="Weather"}
üå¶Ô∏è Mid 80s, mostly sunny. Fewer mosquitos than Schaunaman Ranch.
:::

Visited on Tuesday, September 2, to collect data from *Rhinusa pilosa* grids and *M. janthinus* transects.

## Rhinusa Grids
- No mosquitos; windy
- Plant density similar between control and exclosure
- Lots of garden spiders
- Leafy spurge abundant in exclosure grid, resembling YT in early stages
- More diverse plant community in control grid
- No galls yet (insects not released until now)
- Released 600 insects in both control and exclosure
- Replaced exclosure grid solar panel (button not working)
- Metal cover torn off at control grid

## Transects
- Impossible to find previous transects
- Found both open releases; made new caged-release transects
- Marked ends and middle (10 m) with orange spikes for future reference
- Could not add roadhairs (wrong nail size)
- Retrieved data from 4 loggers; farthest one may be unnecessary
- No externally feeding insects observed, but feeding damage present
- Drove over corn to access site (farmer seeded road anyway)
