**Abstract:** Wheat stem sawfly (WSS), *Cephus cinctus* Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), is a major pest of cereal crops throughout the Northern Great Plains of North America. Native parasitoids, *Bracon cephi* (Gahan) and *B. lissogaster* Muesebeck (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), play a key role in suppressing WSS populations and limiting associated damage. Smooth brome grass (*Bromus inermis* Leyss.) serves as a potential trap reservoir for WSS when grown in areas surrounding wheat (*Triticum aestivum* L.) fields in Montana. Its unique biology allows it to support high WSS infestation while promoting significant larval mortality throughout the growing season. Late-season WSS survivors can then serve as hosts for WSS parasitoids. Our study investigated smooth brome as a host refuge for WSS parasitoids. We measured WSS larval infestation and survival rate inside smooth brome grown within WSS-inclusion cages, finding a maximum infestation of 66.5% and an end-of-year WSS survival of 5.7%. In addition, we collected stems from sites in central and north-central Montana to measure the WSS infestation and parasitoid prevalence in wheat and adjacent smooth brome. WSS infestation was high in both Big Sandy (64.5% smooth brome, 65.7% adjacent wheat) and Moccasin, MT (50.6%, 38.6%). Year-end WSS larval mortality was 43.6% greater in smooth brome compared to adjacent wheat at both field sites, but both hosted similar numbers of WSS parasitoids. This research underscores the importance of smooth brome in providing a sustainable host refuge for WSS parasitoids and highlights its significant role in supporting the economics of wheat cultivation.
