::: {.callout-note title="Weather"}
☀️ High 80s, mostly sunny. 
::: 

I drove back out to Hog Hollow to check in on how things were doing at the site.

## Observations  
- Found the cables for both trail cameras completed chewed and destroyed. Both cameras are out of commision until I get the wiring fixed. Need to do that soon to get the fall herbivory.
- Data loggers and exclosure all in good shape!
