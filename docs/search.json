    "text": "Agroecological importance of smooth brome in managing wheat stem sawfly (Hymenoptera: Cephidae) via associated braconid parasitoids\nAuthors: Jackson R. Strand, Robert K.D. Peterson, Tracy M. Sterling, David K. Weaver\nJournal: Economic Entomology\nDOI: 10.1093/jee/toae246\nAbstract: Wheat stem sawfly (WSS), Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), is a major pest of cereal crops throughout the Northern Great Plains of North America. Native parasitoids, Bracon cephi (Gahan) and B. lissogaster Muesebeck (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), play a key role in suppressing WSS populations and limiting associated damage. Smooth brome grass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) serves as a potential trap reservoir for WSS when grown in areas surrounding wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) fields in Montana. Its unique biology allows it to support high WSS infestation while promoting significant larval mortality throughout the growing season. Late-season WSS survivors can then serve as hosts for WSS parasitoids. Our study investigated smooth brome as a host refuge for WSS parasitoids. We measured WSS larval infestation and survival rate inside smooth brome grown within WSS-inclusion cages, finding a maximum infestation of 66.5% and an end-of-year WSS survival of 5.7%. In addition, we collected stems from sites in central and north-central Montana to measure the WSS infestation and parasitoid prevalence in wheat and adjacent smooth brome. WSS infestation was high in both Big Sandy (64.5% smooth brome, 65.7% adjacent wheat) and Moccasin, MT (50.6%, 38.6%). Year-end WSS larval mortality was 43.6% greater in smooth brome compared to adjacent wheat at both field sites, but both hosted similar numbers of WSS parasitoids. This research underscores the importance of smooth brome in providing a sustainable host refuge for WSS parasitoids and highlights its significant role in supporting the economics of wheat cultivation."

Strand, Oscar G. Perez Moya, Robert K.D. Peterson, Tracy M. Sterling, David K. Weaver\nJournal: Insect Science\nDOI: 10.1093/jisesa/ieaf016\nAbstract: The wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton, is a major pest of cultivated wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and other cereals in North America. The native congeneric parasitoids Bracon cephi (Gahan) and B. lissogaster Muesebeck are important biocontrol agents and play a crucial role in managing wheat stem sawfly outbreaks and damage. Smooth brome grass (Bromus inermis Leyss) has been found to be an effective wheat stem sawfly sink and parasitoid source when grown in areas neighboring wheat fields in Montana. To better understand the ecology of the system, we investigated both the wheat stem sawfly-induced volatile organic compounds produced by smooth brome and winter wheat, and the electrophysiological and behavioral response of B. cephi and B. lissogaster to the collected volatiles via coupled electroantennography and gas chromatography-flame ionization detection. Volatile concentration analysis indicated significantly increased production of (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and (E)-2-hexenal in wheat stem sawfly-infested smooth brome, and elevated production of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one in infested smooth brome and winter wheat when compared to their uninfested counterparts. Both B. cephi and B. lissogaster exhibited significant electrophysiological and behavioral response to (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and hexahydrofarnesyl acetone. Our results provide important evidence supporting habitat management recommendations that will enhance the effectiveness of biological control, contributing to more sustainable agricultural practices and the preservation of vital ecological functions."

Through my research, I seek to develop innovative, nature-based solutions to these complex problems, focusing on the intersection of entomology, ecology, and sustainability.\nMy master‚Äôs thesis with Dr.¬†David Weaver at Montana State University focused on the agroecological role of smooth brome grass in managing wheat stem sawfly (WSS) populations. Specifically, I investigated how smooth brome found along roadways and in coulees could reduce WSS larvae and provide a refuge for parasitoids like Bracon cephi and B. lissogaster. Using a combination of volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis and field observations, I demonstrated that smooth brome, when found growing adjacent to wheat fields, could reduce WSS survival and support second-generation parasitoids. Please see my thesis or my thesis defense recording for more information.\nMy current PhD project with Dr.¬†Robert Peterson at Montana State University is investigating the efficacy of the weevil Rhinusa pilosa for the biological control of invasive yellow toadflax (Linaria vulgaris) in Montana and South Dakota. Specifically, I am interested in the ecological impacts of megaherbivores, parastioids, and climatic shifts on the establishment of beneficial R. pilosa populations."
